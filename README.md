# shelldle
##### Wordle clone in Powershell

A very basic wordle clone written in PowerShell

To play, download or clone repository and run the .\shelldle.ps1 script.

You will be prompted to guess a 5 letter word, which must exist in the word list.

The objective is to guess the hidden word by finding the correct letters in the correct location.  By default you are allowed 6 guesses.

Once guessed the letters will turn yellow for letters that are in the word but in the wrong location, green for letters that are in the word and are in the correct location, and finally grey if the letter is not in the word at all.
